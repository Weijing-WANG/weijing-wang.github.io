## What makes a green space "Instagram-worthy"?

We analyzed 203,000 social media photographs from 186 cities worldwide to understand global preferences for urban nature.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/p3_samples.jpg" title="Sample images" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

## What We Found

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-7 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/p3_findings.jpg" title="Key findings" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-5 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/p3_elements.jpg" title="Design elements" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

**Universal preferences:**  
💧 Water features dominate  
🌸 Seasonal displays attract crowds  
🏛️ Architecture + nature combinations  
🌅 Lighting > location  

**The well-being link:**  
Cities with photo-able green spaces show higher subjective well-being (+0.43 correlation).

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/p3_beijing.jpg" title="Beijing analysis" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

## Why It Matters

Photo-ability isn't vanity—it reflects genuine human preferences for nature in cities.

**For policy:** Data-driven green space investment priorities  
**For design:** Understanding what resonates with people  
**For research:** New methods for measuring public space success
