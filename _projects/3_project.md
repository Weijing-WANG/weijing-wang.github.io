## What makes a green space “Instagram-worthy”?
We analyzed **203,000** social media photos from **186 cities** to learn what people love in urban nature.

---

## The Approach
- Computer vision + BERTopic NLP  
- Flickr API, GIS workflows  
- Global, city-level comparison

---

## Water wins
8 of the top 10 most-photographed landscape elements involve **water**.

---

## Well-being link
Cities with more “photo-able” green–blue spaces show higher subjective well-being  
(correlation ≈ **+0.43**; stronger in high-income cities, p < 0.05).

---

## Design takeaways
**Planners**
- Treat social photos as real-time public space feedback.
- Prioritize **water access**; high ROI for engagement.
- “Shareability” often signals genuine appreciation.

**Policymakers**
- Photo frequency ≈ proxy for cultural ecosystem services.
- Track longitudinal change for policy evaluation.
- Context matters—avoid one-size-fits-all.

**Designers**
- Combine: water features, seasonal variety, wildlife moments,
  architecture–nature integration, and good lighting.
