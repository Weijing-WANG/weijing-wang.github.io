## What makes a green space "Instagram-worthy"?

We analyzed 203,000 social media photographs from 186 cities worldwide to understand global preferences for urban nature.

## The Approach

**203,000 social media images** 
**186 cities** 
**Computer Vision** 
**BERTopic NLP** 

---

## Water wins

8 out of 10 most-photographed landscape features involve water.

**The well-being link:**  
Cities with photo-able green spaces show higher subjective well-being (+0.43 correlation). 

## The happiness equation

Cities with more "photo-able" green-blue spaces report higher well-being.

    In high-income cities: more nature photos = happier residents (p < 0.05). The relationship breaks down in lower-income contexts, suggesting Maslow was right—beauty matters most when basic needs are met.

## What this means for cities

**For urban planners:**
- Use social media data as real-time feedback on public space success
- Prioritize water access—it's the highest-ROI nature investment
- Design for "shareability" isn't superficial; it indicates genuine appreciation

**For policymakers:**
- Photo frequency = proxy for cultural ecosystem service value
- Track changes over time to measure policy impact
- Different cities need different nature—one size doesn't fit all

**For designers:**
- "Photo-able" spaces combine:
  - Water features (primary driver)
  - Seasonal variation 
  - Wildlife interaction opportunities 
  - Architecture + nature integration
  - Golden hour lighting
