## Project Overview

Urban third places—cafes, community centers, and public spaces—serve as vital hubs for social interaction beyond home and work. This research employs spatial modeling and causal inference techniques to understand their impact on neighborhood vitality.

### Research Questions

- How do third places influence foot traffic patterns and economic activity?
- What spatial configurations maximize their positive impact on urban vitality?
- Can we identify causal relationships using propensity score matching and overlap weighting?

### Methods

- **Spatial Analysis**: Network analysis of accessibility patterns
- **Causal Inference**: Propensity score matching (PSM) and generalized propensity score matching (GPSM)
- **Big Data**: Mobile phone GPS traces and POI data from Singapore
