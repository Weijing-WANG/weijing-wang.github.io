My work bridges landscape perception, big-data analytics and spatio-temporal social practices to understand how people interact with urban environments. I am particularly interested in how artificial intelligence and digital media shape humanâ€“environment interaction and what this means for individual and collective well-being. My current research focuses on urban vitality and vibrancy under conditions of intensification, aiming to develop interdisciplinary frameworks that link digital technology, design and health-oriented planning.</p> </body></html>
